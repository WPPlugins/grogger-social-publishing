WARNING: Grogger Social Publishing is being replaced with the Kapost Social Publishing plugin. Both are made by the same team but future updates and releases will be in the Kapost plugin and we recommend you switch to that.

The Grogger plug-in allows WordPress sites to develop an entire community of post contributors, providing more content and more audience engagement. 

== Description ==

The Grogger plug-in allows WordPress sites to develop an entire community of post contributors, providing more content and more audience engagement. 

The plug-in creates a sidebar widget that displays links to posts submitted from the community (sorted by recency, popularity, etc.). The widget also contains a "submit a post" button that on click displays a text editor in a pop-up that a site visitor can use to submit a post. 

Grogger importantly creates a "secondary space," a set of additional pages where community submitted posts reside. This gives some exposure for the post so that the user is motivated to contribute while keeping the posts out of the primary Wordpress post feed. The Wordpress site owner can then choose which posts from the community they would like to "promote" into the primary post feed. 

Additional Wordpress site owner benefits: 
   * spam-block control to prevent unwanted posts
   * community-filtering of content through community voting system


Additional community contributor benefits: 
   * easy user registration and authentication through Facebook, Twitter, etc. 
   * user profile pages where users can develop community identity, providing incentive to post content
